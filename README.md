# DISTANCE CONVERTER
In a world where accuracy and convenience in measurement conversions are essential, a 
versatile distance converter tool is invaluable. This project aims to develop an efficient, user-friendly distance converter application capable of converting various distance units (such as kilometers, miles, meters, and feet) instantly. With a responsive interface and precise calculation engine, this tool is designed to cater to diverse needs, from academic and professional use to everyday measurements.
# Socket Architecture
The socket architecture in this Distance Converter Application forms the backbone of real-time, two-way communication between the client and the server. This design ensures that conversion requests are processed efficiently, providing users with instantaneous responses. The architecture leverages both Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), combining reliability and speed to cater to different use cases and requirements. This section explores how each protocol supports the application’s functionality, emphasizing their specific contributions to delivering a responsive, scalable, and robust distance conversion service.
